        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
            <p> &#x2022; 12 ounces (340g) dried elbow macaroni (about 6 cups dry pasta)</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 2 teaspoons oregano</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more as needed for salting the pasta water</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1 teaspoon black pepper</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1 teaspoon chili powder</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>    
            <p> &#x2022; 2 teaspoons butter</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1 tablespoon minced garlic</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1/4 cup tomato puree</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1 1/2 cups heavy cream</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1/4 cup chicken stock</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 1/2 teaspoon dried basil</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</p>
            <p> &#x2022; 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure">
            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p><br>
            <p>Boil the pasta:</p>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).</p>
            <p>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes, until mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite.</p>
            <p>Using a colander, drain and set to the side.</p><br>
            <p>Cook the ground beef:</p>
            <p>As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef. </p>
            <p>Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</p><br>
            <p>Add the butter and aromatics:</p>
            <p>Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef. Stir until all ingredients are combined.</p><br>
            <p>Combine the pasta and ground beef:</p>
            <p>Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine. Add the heavy whipping cream, chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese. Stir until combined.</p><br>
            <p>Add to a casserole dish:</p>
            <p>Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the remaining cheese.</p><br>
            <p>Bake:</p>
            <p>Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and bubbly.</p><br>
            <p>Serve and store:</p>
            <p>For a looser casserole, serve right away. For a casserole that holds its shape a bit, let sit 10 minutes before serving. </p>
            <p>The casserole will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.</p>
            <p>You can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months. To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350°F oven until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you are reheating).</p>
